You are a senior frontend engineer and UI/UX designer.

Create a complete single-page landing page for an event called "AI Developer Workshop".
Everything must be in ONE HTML file:
- semantic HTML
- one <style> block with CSS
- one <script> block with vanilla JavaScript
- no external frameworks or imports.

Requirements:
1) Hero section at the top:
   - Title: “AI Developer Workshop”
   - Short subtitle (1–2 sentences) about learning AI tools for developers
   - Primary button: “Join the workshop”
   - Secondary button: “View agenda”

2) Features section with 3 cards:
   - “Code Assistants”
   - “AI APIs & Integration”
   - “Best Practices & Ethics”
   Each card: icon (emoji is fine), title, short description.

3) Section titled “Why AI tools matter for developers”
   - 3–4 bullet points about productivity, clean code, collaboration, responsible AI.

4) Simple “Schedule” section
   - 3 steps (Intro, Live Demo, Q&A) in a simple vertical or horizontal timeline.

5) Visual style:
   - Clean modern SaaS look, soft gradient background or subtle shapes
   - Rounded cards, soft shadows, comfortable spacing
   - Use system fonts only.

6) Dark mode:
   - Add a dark mode toggle in the top-right (e.g. 🌙 / ☀️)
   - Clicking it toggles a "dark-mode" class on <body>
   - Define CSS for both light and dark, with smooth color transitions.

7) Floating chat bubble:
   - Floating button bottom-right labeled “AI Helper”
   - When clicked, open a small glassmorphism-style panel above it
   - Panel shows 3 static questions & answers:
     - “What will I learn?”
     - “Do I need AI experience?”
     - “Is the workshop hands-on?”
   - Clicking again (or a close icon) closes the panel.

8) Interactions & responsiveness:
   - Hover effect: feature cards slightly lift with stronger shadow
   - “Join the workshop” button scrolls smoothly to the “Why AI tools matter” section
   - Use flexbox or CSS grid so layout is responsive:
     - On small screens: center hero text and stack feature cards vertically.
