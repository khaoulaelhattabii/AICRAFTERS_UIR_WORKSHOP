You are a senior frontend designer and creative director.

Take the existing HTML landing page I gave you and transform it into a premium, high-tech event website.
Keep everything in ONE HTML file and keep the main sections already present,
but enhance the design and add the following:

1) Enhanced hero:
   - Subtle animated background (gradient waves or floating shapes)
   - Short tagline under the title (e.g. “Master the tools that boost modern software engineering”)
   - Small badges under the buttons: “Free Entry”, “Hands-on”, “For Developers”
   - Small animated arrow pointing down (“scroll to explore”).

2) “What You Will Learn” section:
   - 4 blocks in a responsive grid:
     - AI-powered code assistants
     - API integration techniques
     - Prompt engineering
     - Best practices for responsible AI
   - Each block: icon, title, 2–3 line description.

3) “Speakers” section:
   - 3 speaker cards with round photo placeholders, name, title, and short bio.
   - On hover: card lifts slightly with a soft glow.

4) “Workshop Program Timeline”:
   - 4 steps: Introduction, Tools & Best Practices, Live Demo, Q&A + Networking.
   - Each step has an icon and short description.
   - Use simple fade-in animation on scroll (with vanilla JS and CSS).

5) “Testimonials” section:
   - 3 testimonial bubbles with quotes from past attendees.
   - Subtle sliding or auto-carousel-style animation.

6) “Registration Form” section:
   - Fake form with fields: Name, Email, City, Experience Level (dropdown).
   - Button: “Register Now”.
   - Simple JavaScript validation (require all fields).
   - On success, show a modal-style success popup with a short confirmation message.

7) Footer:
   - Contact email
   - Small social media icons (can use emojis)
   - Copyright line
   - Text: “Made with ❤️ using AI”.

8) Style & dark mode:
   - Use premium SaaS look: glassmorphism panels, gradients, vibrant accent color, smooth transitions.
   - Improve dark mode: good contrast, animated transitions when toggling, adapt shapes and accents for dark theme.

9) AI Helper bubble:
   - Keep the bubble but improve the panel with:
     - small typing animation effect
     - a fake “AI is thinking…” shimmer bar
     - an extra Q&A item.
